          <p>This is a prototype for a site that would be used to find the highest rated sights and locations in a given city, based on user reviews. I worked on a team with 2 other developers, with the challenge of creating the site from the ground up in just 4 days.</p>

      <section class="process">
      <h2 class="subHeading2">Process</h2>
      <p>The first step for this project was to determine how large the scope of the prototype would be, given the 4 day time constraint. The MVP features were narrowed down to being able to view a few example cities, which would each have some example locations built-in based on categories. Those categories could then be filtered to narrow the results.</p>
      <p>My main role on this project was writing the functionality with JavaScript and Jquery. As well as some of the design choices and logo. After the HTML structure was written, there was a list of features that needed to be written with JS, so I went down the list and broke each step into small pieces. The end result is what could be done in a short amount of time, but this is a project I would like to revisit in the future.</p>
