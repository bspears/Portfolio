          <p>Sass Pants is the beginning of a lightweight UI library that I have built from the ground up. It is desingned to make building reusable design modules simple and fast. The library can be installed as a Bower package and used with
          Sass. The site for Sass Pants was also built using it.</p>

      <p>This began as a project to get familiar with the creation of Bower packages. Rather than create a test package that I would never use again, I decided to start a small UI library that I could then continue to build on and implement in my future projects. First I built an extremely simple 12 column grid system that would be included in the package. After that I started making mixins that would lend them self to the way I build modules with CSS. I used these mixins to build the layout of the site as I went to show how the tools could be used. I plan on continuing to add to this library and develop the documentation as it grows.</p>
