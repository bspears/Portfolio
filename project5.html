          <p>This was a small project I did for a class at Code Fellows. The goal was to create a small demo that would illustrate how a sort function in JavaScript works.</p>

      <section class="process">
      <h2 class="subHeading2">Process</h2>
      <p>I chose the "insert" sort method, and began the process by building a very simple HTML outline with no styles. I created the feature to add numbers to an array by pressing a button. Once I had the array that could be sorted, I created the function to sort them using an insert sort method. The array is then animated to show the sort in progress. After the functionality was complete, I styled the page with a quick flat design that is also responsive.</p>
